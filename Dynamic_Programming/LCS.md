## Longest Common Subsequence

#### Core concept

Finding the longest sequence that appears in the same relative order in two strings, but not necessarily contiguously.

#### Approach

It uses Dynamic Programming by building a 2D table to store the lengths of common subsequences.

#### Complexity

The time complexity is $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of the two strings.
